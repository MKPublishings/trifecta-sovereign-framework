# Trifecta Sovereign Framework

### 🔮 Overview
The **Trifecta Sovereign Framework** is a mythic–technical architecture developed by **MK Publishings**. It unifies **creative, financial, and cosmic cycles** into a single sovereign system, blending **law, ceremony, and technology** into a living archive. Each artifact, protocol, and cycle is inscribed as part of a **public legacy**, ensuring sovereignty, discipline, and universal access.
