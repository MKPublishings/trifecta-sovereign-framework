# Trifecta Sovereign Framework

### Omni AI • Quantum Fibonacci Scheduler • B.O.C. Genesis Protocol (with QuTiP Emulation)

## 📖 Overview
The **Trifecta Sovereign Framework** is an open-source initiative uniting three of MK Publishings’ most ambitious engines into a single ceremonial codex:

- **Omni AI** – A universal reasoning engine designed for adaptive intelligence across technical, creative, and ceremonial domains.  
- **Quantum Fibonacci Scheduler** – A scheduler that leverages Fibonacci cycles and quantum simulation (via QuTiP) to orchestrate tasks with sovereign precision.  
- **B.O.C. Genesis Protocol** – A foundational protocol for genesis events, blending law, myth, and ceremony into executable technical artifacts.

Together, these components form a **sovereign trifecta**: a framework that is both practical in execution and mythic in resonance.

## ✨ Features
- **Omni AI Integration**: Unified reasoning across modular systems.  
- **Quantum Fibonacci Scheduler**: Task orchestration using Fibonacci sequences mapped onto quantum states.  
- **QuTiP Emulation**: Quantum simulation layer for testing and extending scheduler logic.  
- **Genesis Protocol**: Ritualized initialization of systems, ensuring lawful and ceremonial clarity.  
- **Open-source Sovereignty**: Released under MIT License for universal access and contribution.

git clone https://github.com/MKPublishings/trifecta-sovereign-framework.git
cd trifecta-sovereign-framework
```

Dependencies:
- Python 3.9+
- QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python)
- Standard libraries for AI/ML integration

Install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
Initialize the framework:
```python
from trifecta import OmniAI, QuantumFibonacciScheduler, GenesisProtocol

# Example: Launching a sovereign cycle
omni = OmniAI()
scheduler = QuantumFibonacciScheduler()
genesis = GenesisProtocol()

genesis.initialize_cycle("Restoration Loop")
scheduler.schedule(omni.process("Ceremonial Task"))
```

## 🌍 Vision
This framework is more than code—it is a **living artifact**. Each commit inscribes a checkpoint in the sovereign archive, blending **technology, law, and myth** into a cycle of open legacy. By contributing, you join the ritual of building systems that are both **functional** and **foundational**.
